                I combine georeferenced data on mining and oil endowments with satellite-images of land use and census data on 112 million individuals from 2,700 regions in 23 countries to show that resource extraction and international trade have fuelled Africa's recent structural transformation. In the first part of my analysis, I document that both increases in the values of regional natural resource endowments, induced by global price shocks, as well as a U.S. policy change, lowering tariffs on African imports, which affected regions close to ports more strongly, lead to reallocations away from agriculture towards services. The natural resource and trade shocks are re-enforcing in their effect on agriculture and services, but neither crowds out manufacturing employment, which even expands in response to the trade shock. In the second part of the analysis, I develop and then calibrate a quantitative multi-region multi-industry trade model of structural transformation. There are two forces at play. Increases of local incomes in mining regions increase the demand for non-tradables whereas reduced external trade costs, by lowering the prices of tradable goods, favour locations better connected to international markets. I find the correlation between model-predicted and observed labour share changes to be around 55 percent. Which of the two forces dominate in explaining observed structural transformation depends on the spatial configuration of location-specific access to international markets and natural resource advantages. The analysis concludes with counterfactual simulations of the structural change implications of larger resource booms and autarky.

                We examine intergenerational mobility (IM) in educational attainment in Africa since independence, using census data from 26 countries. First, we map and characterize the geography of IM.  There is substantial variation both across and within countries with differences in literacy of the old generation being the strongest correlate of IM. Inertia is stronger for rural, as compared to urban, households and present for both boys and girls. Second, we explore the correlates of mobility across more than 2,800 regions. Colonial investments in the transportation network and missionary activity are associated with upward mobility. IM is also higher in regions close to the coast and national capitals as well as in rugged areas without malaria. Upward mobility is higher and downward mobility is lower in regions that were more developed at independence, with higher urbanization and employment in services and manufacturing. Third, we identify the effects of regions on educational mobility by exploiting within-family variation from children whose families moved during primary school age. While sorting is sizable, there are considerable regional exposure effects.

                We investigate the evolution of inequality and intergenerational mobility in educational attainment across ethnic and religious lines in Africa. Using census data covering more
                than 70 million people in 19 countries we document the following regularities. (1) There are large differences in intergenerational mobility both across and within countries across cultural groups. Most broadly, Christians are more mobile than Muslims who are more mobile than people following traditional religions. (2) The average country-wide education level of the group in the generation of individuals' parents is a strong predictor of grouplevel mobility in that more mobile groups also were previously more educated. This holds both across religions and ethnicities, within ethnicities controlling for religion and vice versa, as well as for two individuals from different groups growing up in the same region within a country. (3) Considering a range of variables, we find some evidence that mobility correlates negatively with discrimination in the political arena post indepdence, and that mobility is higher for groups that historically derived most of their subsistence from agriculture as opposed to pastoralism.
