              We study the labor market consequences of ethnic politics in African democracies. Using subnational
              georeferenced data from 15 countries from 1996 to 2017, we compare individuals from ethnicities linked to
              parties at the margin of electing a representative in the national parliament. Having a local ethnic party
              politician in parliament increases the likelihood of being employed by 2-3 percentage points. The effect
              is concentrated in the agricultural sector and mostly driven by self-employment, suggesting increased
              access to land as the main channel. We also show that religion and age are salient markers in African
              politics that trigger similar employment effects.

              The African people and leaders have long seen education as a driving force of development and liberation,
              a view shared by international institutions, as schooling has significant economic and non-economic
              returns, particularly in low-income settings.
              In this study, we examine the educational progress across faiths throughout post-colonial Africa, home to
              some of the world's largest Christian and Muslim communities. We construct novel religion-specific
              measures of intergenerational mobility in education (IM) using census data from more than 2,000 districts
              in 21 countries and document the following. First, Christians have better mobility outcomes than
              Traditionalists and Muslims. Second, differences in IM between Christians and Muslims persist among those
              residing in the same district, in households with comparable economic and family backgrounds. Third, while
              Muslims benefit as much as Christians when they move early in life to high-mobility regions, they appear
              less likely to do so. Their low internal mobility accentuates the educational deficit, as Muslims reside
              in less urbanized, more remote with limited infrastructure areas. Fourth, the Christian-Muslim gap is most
              prominent in areas with large Muslim communities, where the latter also register the lowest emigration
              rates. As African governments and international organizations invest heavily in educational programs, our
              findings highlight the need to understand better the private and social returns to schooling across faiths
              in religiously segregated communities and carefully think about religious inequalities in the take-up of
              educational policies.

              We examine intergenerational mobility (IM) in educational attainment in Africa since independence using
              census data. First, we map IM across 27 countries and more than 2,800 regions, documenting wide
              cross-country and especially within-country heterogeneity. Inertia looms large as differences in the
              literacy of the old generation explain about half of the observed spatial disparities in IM. The
              rural-urban divide is substantial. Though conspicuous in some countries, there is no evidence of
              systematic gender gaps in IM. Second, we characterize the geography of IM, finding that colonial
              investments in railroads and Christian missions, as well as proximity to capitals and the coastline are
              the strongest correlates. Third, we ask whether the differences in mobility across regions reflect spatial
              sorting or the independent role of the former. To isolate the two, we focus on children whose families
              moved when they were young. Comparing siblings, looking at moves triggered by displacement shocks, and
              using historical migrations to predict moving-familiesâ€™ destinations, we establish that, while selection
              is considerable, regional exposure effects are at play. An extra year spent in a high-mobility region
              before the age of 12 (and after 5) significantly raises the likelihood for children of uneducated parents
              to complete primary school. Overall, the evidence suggests that geographic and historical factors laid the
              seeds for spatial disparities in IM that are cemented by sorting and the independent impact of regions.

              I combine georeferenced data on mining and oil endowments with satellite-images of land use and census
              data on 112 million individuals from 2,700 regions in 23 countries to show that resource extraction and
              international trade have fuelled Africa's recent structural transformation. In the first part of my
              analysis, I document that both increases in the values of regional natural resource endowments, induced by
              global price shocks, as well as a U.S. policy change, lowering tariffs on African imports, which affected
              regions close to ports more strongly, lead to reallocations away from agriculture towards services. The
              natural resource and trade shocks are re-enforcing in their effect on agriculture and services, but
              neither crowds out manufacturing employment, which even expands in response to the trade shock. In the
              second part of the analysis, I develop and then calibrate a quantitative multi-region multi-industry trade
              model of structural transformation. There are two forces at play. Increases of local incomes in mining
              regions increase the demand for non-tradables whereas reduced external trade costs, by lowering the prices
              of tradable goods, favour locations better connected to international markets. I find the correlation
              between model-predicted and observed labour share changes to be around 55 percent. Which of the two forces
              dominate in explaining observed structural transformation depends on the spatial configuration of
              location-specific access to international markets and natural resource advantages. The analysis concludes
              with counterfactual simulations of the structural change implications of larger resource booms and
              autarky.
